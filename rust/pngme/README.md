# PNGME Rust project

From https://jrdngr.github.io/pngme_book/introduction.html

## What are we making?

We're making a command line program that lets you hide secret messages in PNG files. Your program will have four commands:

1. Encode a message into a PNG file
1. Decode a message stored in a PNG file
1. Remove a message from a PNG file
1. Print a list of PNG chunks that can be searched for messages
